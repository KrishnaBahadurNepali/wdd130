        <p>Hi, this is Krishna Bahadur Nepali from Nepal. I have recently working in SELF-HELP NEPAL for 5 years
            and I am an electronics and communication Engineer. I am also very much interested in website designing 
            and computer programming. I like to do mountain hike and cycling🚴‍♂️. I love playing flute, piano and harmonica.
             I make drones and sell them. I love to write poems and parodies. In my free time, I invent electronics things and 
             make handicrafts from wheat straw and bamboo. I read novels and watch Book of Mormon story videos. 
             Thank you for taking the time to learn about me.</p>

      <p>Nepal is a beautiful landlocked country where many mountains, waterfalls, lakes, and the diversity of ethnic groups abide.
        It is a sovereign country with brave Gorkha soldiers famous in the world. Many people travel to see the different cultures of people 
        , and religions with the significance of their ritual. Nepal is the place with the highest Himalayan called Mt. Everest, the tallest mountain in the world, and the birthplace of Buddha called the creator of peace.
        We heartily welcome all the people from the world to see the real heaven on this earth.
