      <h2>Nepal</h2>

      <p><i>Nepal is a beautiful landlocked country where many mountains, waterfalls, lakes, and the diversity of ethnic groups abide.
        It is a sovereign country with brave Gorkha soldiers famous in the world. Many people travel to see the different cultures of people 
        ,and religions with the significance of their ritual. Nepal is the place with the highest Himalayan called Mt. Everest,
        the tallest mountain in the world, and the birthplace of Buddha called the creator of peace.
        We heartily welcome all the people from the world to see the real heaven on this earth.
        The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, the era in ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded,
        the predominant religion of the country. In the middle of the first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. 
        Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet. The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans,
        and was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala.
